# SP_25_Transportation  
**CDJ Spring 25 Transportation Analysis**  

## Team Members:  
**Tianyi Chen (PL), Ricky Cheng, Emi Labbe, Arnav Shah, Stella Zhang**  

## Project Overview:  
In this project, we explore the relationship between transportation factors and high school graduation rates. Using data provided by the New York City Department of Education and the city's transportation department, we analyze how commuting patterns affect student graduation outcomes.  

## Datasets:  
- [Transportation Sites Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Transportation-Sites/hg3c-2jsy/about_data)  
- [Graduation Results Data](https://infohub.nyced.org/reports/academics/graduation-results)  

## Data Processing & Code Notes:  
Due to the variety of tools used by the team for data processing, we don't have a single unified codebase for this project. A brief explanation of our workflow:  
- One team member used **Tableau** for visual analysis, and another used **Excel**. As a result, there is no code to upload for these individuals.  
- One team member's visualizations were ultimately not included in the final analysis, so their code is also not provided.

- The data cleaning process was done individually by team members, with each focusing on different features and creating visualizations in a way that suited their preferred tools.
  
- We have uploaded the code for the visualizations included in the final report:  
  - **Google Colab** (Python-based)  
  - **R script**
